# Study Session - January 1, 2024

**Date:** 2024-01-01  
**Duration:** 1 hour 30 minutes  
**Focus Area:** Arrays and Hash Tables

## Goals for This Session

- [x] Understand hash table approach for array problems
- [x] Solve Two Sum problem
- [ ] Solve Three Sum problem (moved to next session)

## Problems Solved

### 1. Two Sum
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Status:** ✅ Solved
- **Time Spent:** 45 minutes
- **Link to Solution:** [problems/easy/two-sum.md](../problems/easy/two-sum.md)
- **Notes:** Initially tried brute force O(n²) approach, then optimized to O(n) using hash table. Key insight was recognizing the complement pattern.

## Key Concepts Learned

1. **Hash Table Pattern:** Using dictionaries/hash maps for O(1) lookup is crucial for optimizing array problems
2. **Complement Technique:** For problems involving sums, storing (target - current) helps find pairs efficiently
3. **Space-Time Tradeoff:** Sometimes using O(n) extra space can reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n)

## Challenges Faced

- Initially struggled with deciding when to add elements to the hash map vs. when to check for complements
- Realized that checking first, then adding prevents using the same element twice
- Had to review hash table time complexity guarantees

## Review Notes

- Hash tables are fundamental for many array problems
- Practice more problems involving the complement pattern
- Always consider: "Can a hash table help here?"

## Next Session Goals

- [ ] Solve Three Sum (Medium difficulty)
- [ ] Practice more hash table problems
- [ ] Review two-pointer technique for sorted arrays

## Overall Progress

- **Total Problems Solved:** 1
- **Easy:** 1
- **Medium:** 0
- **Hard:** 0

## Reflection

Great start! The Two Sum problem is a classic that demonstrates the power of hash tables. Taking time to understand both the brute force and optimized solution was valuable. Need to practice more to recognize these patterns faster. Looking forward to tackling medium difficulty problems next.
